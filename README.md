PROJECT NEW WL-World (Based on Shoebill)
=================
Based on the idea of WL-World, we reproduce New WL-World by using Java and the Shoebill API. 
There is no connection between the New WL-World and WL-World, but we still want to say "Thank you" for the people who make a contribution on the WL-World.

* Using hot-keys in order to simplify basic instructions.
* Provide statistics and report function as far as possible.
* Provide the re-edit function for all user data which generated in game as much as we can.
* Ensure that the functions in the project are dynamic-adaptatable.
* Make sure the code is easy to read.
* High quality of the code.
