PROJECT NEW WL-World (Based on Shoebill)
=================
Based on the idea of WL-World, we reproduce New WL-World by using Java and the Shoebill API. 
There is no connection between the New WL-World and WL-World, but we still want to say "Thank you" for the people who make a contribution on the WL-World.
